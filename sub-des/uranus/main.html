                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p><strong>Uranus</strong> is the seventh planet from the Sun and has the third largest diameter our solar system.
                    Uranus is very cold and windy and rotates at a nearly 90 degree angle from its plane of orbit.

                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Uranus is formed around 4.5 billion years ago with a radius of 15,759.2 miles (25,362 kilometers).
                    From an average distance of 1.8 billion miles (2.9 billion kilometers), Uranus is 19.8 astronomical units 
                    away from the Sun<a href="#footnotes">*</a>. 
                    It takes about 2 hours and 40 minutes for light from the Sun to reach Uranus. <br>

                    <strong>Potential for Life:</strong> <br>
                    Uranus's environment is not too conducive to life as we know it. The temperatures, pressures and materials are most likey too 
                    extreme and volatile for living organisms to adapt to.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Orbit and Rotation:</strong>  <br>
                    A day on Uranus takes about 17 hours, and completes an orbit around the Sun in about 84 Earth years. Uranus is the only planet 
                    whos nearly orbiting at a right angle - with a axis of rotation of 97.77 degrees. The tilt is probably caused from a collision 
                    with a Earth like planet. This tilt causes the most extreme seasons in the solar system.
                    This means that, like Earth, Saturn experiences seasons.<br><br>
                    <strong>Structure:</strong>  <br>
                    Uranus is one of the two ice giants in the outer solar system. 80% or more of its mass is made up from hot dense fluid 
                    of "icy" materials - water, methane and ammonia. Near the core, it heats up to 4,982 degrees Celsius (9,000 degrees Fahrenheit).<br><br>
                    <strong>Temperatures:</strong>  <br>
                    The temperature on Uranus is around minus 214 degrees Celsius (minus 353 degrees Fahrenheit), with the coldest temperature found so far 
                    of minus 224 degrees Celsius (minus 371 degrees Fahrenheit).<br><br>
                    <strong>Surface:</strong> <br>
                    As a gas giant, Saturn doesnâ€™t have a true surface. The planet is mostly swirling gases and liquids deeper down. <br><br>
                    <strong>Atmosphere:</strong> <br>
                    Uranus' atmosphere is mostly made of hydrogen and helium, with a small ammount of methane, water and ammonia. It is the methane 
                    that gives Uranus its signature blue colour. Uranus' atmosphere, with a minimum temperature of 49K (-224.2 degrees Celsius) 
                    makes it even colder than Neptune in some places. The wind speeds up to 560 miles per hour (900 kilometers per hour) on Uranus.<br><br>
                    <strong>Magetosphere:</strong> <br>
                    Uranus has an unusual, irregularly shaped magnetosphere - Uranus' magnetic field is tipped over by nearly 60 degrees from the planet's axis 
                    of rotation, and is also offset from the center by about one third of the planet's radius. The magnetosphere tail behind Uranus opposite 
                    the Sun extends into space for millions of miles. <br><br>
                    <strong>Moons: </strong> <br>
                    Uranus has 27 known moons. All of Uranus' inner moons appear to be roughly half water ice and half rock. The composition of the outer moons 
                    remains unknown, but they are likely captured asteroids. <br><br>
                    <strong>Rings: </strong> <br>
                    Uranus has two sets of rings, the inner system has nine rings and the outer system has four <a href="#footnotes">**</a>.
